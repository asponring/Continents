Continents
==========

This is a fun little app that displays info about continents.

Steps to run:
1. Run the node server "server.js"
2. Go to localhost:8080/continents.html
3. Click on the continent images to get info about them

Concepts I used in this projects:
1. Parsing JSON objects
2. AJAX requests
3. Using local storage save data already fetched from server
4. Event handlers
